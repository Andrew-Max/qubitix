                <p>Great web and mobile apps are more than just code. They are the cumulutive result of thousands of small visual and technical design decisions. We carefully research your business and challenges and create detailed visual and technical design documents from prototypes to high fidelity ready to build designs.</p>

                <p>At our core, we're software craftsman. With our decades of cumulative experience, if you can think of it, we can build it. If we are starting from scratch, we evaluate the project and pick the optimal stack for the job. If you've already started developing, we'll select our team members who already have experience in the tools you are using.</p>

                <p>It's not enough simply to be technically competent. Complicated projects have a lot of moving pieces and need to be carefully managed. We are strong believers in sprint based agile and scrum, and well planned, time estimated work. This allows us to stay on time and on budget while enabling us to be flexible in terms of project scope.</p>

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Software Craftsmanship" asset="tool-box"
          class="craftsmanship" %}
            <p>We are adamant about using best practices like extensive test coverage, pull requests with code reviews, and continuous integration and deployment to ensure an exceptionally high level of code quality and productivity.</p>
        {% include principle_card_end.html%}

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Design Thinking" asset="brainstorm"
          class="design" %}
            <p>Research, design, build, iterate. These concepts are equally crucial to creating stunning UIs as they are to building reliable and performant software. We take an creative design based approach to every problem we tackle.</p>
        {% include principle_card_end.html%}

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Open Communication" asset="conversation"
          class="communication" %}
            <p>Communication is the life blood of every project. We understand the importance of keeping multiple open lines of communication and promptly responding to questions and feedback. We hear you. </p>
        {% include principle_card_end.html%}

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Collaboration" asset="network"
          class="collaboration" %}
            <p>Good software is not built in a vacuum and we're not the types to sit in a dark room alone and code. We take a collaborative approach to every project both with our clients and in our internal dev and design processes.</p>
        {% include principle_card_end.html%}

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Sprint Based Agile" asset="planning"
          class='agile' %}
            <p>No one specific set of development processes is sufficient to orgnanize work on all projects. We do believe however that short (1-3 week) estimated sprints allow us to move fast while allowing sufficient time to re-evaluate scope and change if necessary.</p>
        {% include principle_card_end.html%}

        {% include principle_card_start.html
          title="Flexibility" asset="flexibility" class="flexible"%}
            <p>All of our processes stem from our value that good work and relationships come from flexible teams. We adapt to new circumstances as they come up and to the specific processes that work for each individual client.</p>
